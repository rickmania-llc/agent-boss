# Implementation Architecture Plan — DEEP

## 1) Executive Overview
- Problem, objectives/KPIs, constraints/assumptions
- Sources: [ai-docs/research files]

## 2) Background & Current State
- Runtime topology, versions, known bottlenecks
- Incidents/findings relevant here

## 3) Target Architecture (C4-guided)
- System context → Containers → Components (with request paths)
- Data design: schemas, indices, retention, lineage
- Eventing/orchestration: topics, message shapes, retry/DLQ, idempotency

## 4) Contracts
- REST/GraphQL/Socket/gRPC specs (status codes, errors, pagination)
- Compatibility windows & deprecation policy

## 5) Reliability, Performance, Security
- SLOs & budgets per hop; capacity & cost projection
- Failure modes, timeouts, circuit breakers, fallbacks
- Threat model, mTLS/JWT/service-to-service auth, secret handling, PII

## 6) Decisions (ADRs)
- ADR-001… with rejected alternatives & trade-off matrix (brief)

## 7) Implementation Tracks
- Track 1: Foundations (platform, shared libs, toggles)
- Track 2: Feature Enablement
- Track 3: Observability / SLOs
- Track 4: Hardening / Cost
> Each track: tasks (with repo paths), owners, estimates, dependencies, success criteria.

## 8) Verification
- Test matrix: unit/integration/contract/e2e/chaos/perf
- Data validation & backfill verification (if applicable)
- Security tests (authZ, rate-limit, SSRF, injection, secrets)

## 9) Rollout & Runbooks
- Flags with defaults, exposure by cohort/tenant
- Dashboards/alerts and concrete log IDs
- Rollback (including data), post-cutover cleanup

## 10) Story Seeds (index only)
- One-liners + acceptance bullets; detailed stories deferred downstream
