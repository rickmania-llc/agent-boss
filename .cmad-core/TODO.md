### CMAD TODO

- Have story creator add code conventions
- Create verifier agents who checks stories after they are created, and one who checks code after written
- Create separate testing and revisions agent (Or have dev agent do this)
- Update the developer agent to use a test instruction file rather than hard coding yarn test instructions
- Testing guide which explains unit test and E2E structure, and how to run tests
- Have story creator focus on creating 2-5 stories instead of 5 - 10
