I have given the following requirements:

- Allow users to create email lists which can be attached to Automated Actions
- If the automated action is triggered, every address in that list should receive an email notification
- Though the project has a default email server using AWS, allow the client to optionally set up their own SMTP Server
- The SMTP set-up should mirror the functionality of the Site Manager project
