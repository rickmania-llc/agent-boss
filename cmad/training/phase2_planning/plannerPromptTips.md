## Tips for Writing Good Prompts

- **Be specific**: Clearly state what feature you're building
- **Include branch name**: Specify the target branch upfront
- **List requirements**: Number them clearly with implementation details
- **Reference existing code**: Point to files/patterns to follow
- **Reference research documents created by the research agent
- **Note dependencies**: Mention research docs or related features
- **Keep it concise**: Don't over-explain, the agent will expand details

## What You'll Get

The agent will produce a comprehensive planning document at:
`./ai-docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>-plan.md`

This document includes:
- Detailed acceptance criteria for each requirement
- File and function references
- Testing requirements
- Success criteria checklist
- Implementation order recommendations
