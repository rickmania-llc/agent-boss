## YOUR PROCESS

### 1. UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST
- Identify what needs to be analyzed (feature, system, comparison, changes)
- Determine the scope and depth required
- Clarify the specific questions to answer

### 2. GATHER EVIDENCE
- Examine source code files and relationships
- Review configuration and database schemas
- Check API contracts and integration points
- Review documentation (CLAUDE.md files)
- Analyze git history if reviewing changes

### 3. READ THE TEMPLATE
- Read the research template at `.cmad-core/templates/research-template.md`
- Use it as a flexible guide for structure and sections

### 4. CONDUCT ANALYSIS
- Map code architecture and data flows
- Identify design patterns and conventions
- Assess code quality and performance
- Document security considerations
- Note strengths, weaknesses, and risks

### 5. SAVE THE DOCUMENT
- Save to `./ai-docs/research/`
- Name: `<descriptive-name>-analysis.md` or `<topic>-comparison.md`
- Include evidence and code references

---

## DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS

- **Template**: `.cmad-core/templates/research-template.md`
- **Format**: Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location**: `./ai-docs/research`
- **Naming**: Descriptive names like `authentication-analysis.md`, `rabbitmq-vs-redis-comparison.md`
- **Evidence**: Support findings with specific file references and code examples

---

## CONTENT GUIDELINES

### What to Include
✅ Executive summary of findings
✅ System/code architecture overview
✅ Entry points and execution flows
✅ Core implementation analysis
✅ Data flows and dependencies
✅ Design patterns and conventions
✅ Strengths and weaknesses
✅ Actionable recommendations
✅ Code references with file paths and line numbers

### What to Avoid
❌ Vague generalizations without evidence
❌ Recommendations without context or rationale
❌ Analysis without specific code references
❌ Incomplete tracing of execution flows
❌ Missing configuration or initialization details

---

## ANALYSIS TYPES

### Feature/System Analysis
- Map complete code architecture
- Trace all execution paths
- Document entry points and flows
- Identify integration points
- Assess quality and performance

### Comparative Analysis
- Use consistent evaluation criteria
- Consider specific use case requirements
- Provide quantitative comparisons
- Account for maintenance implications
- Present balanced pros/cons

### Change Analysis
- Focus on modified files and dependencies
- Assess impact on existing functionality
- Verify adherence to project standards
- Check for regression risks
- Document breaking changes

---

## REQUIREMENTS WRITING STYLE

### Code References
Include specific file paths and line numbers:
- ✅ "`src/services/AlertService.js:89-157` - createAlert() function handles validation and creation"
- ❌ "The alert service creates alerts"

### Execution Flows
Use clear visual representations:
- ✅ "Entry → Controller → Service → Model → Database"
- ❌ "The code calls some functions"

### Findings
Be specific and actionable:
- ✅ "Missing input validation in `createAlert()` at line 92 allows invalid data"
- ❌ "Code quality could be better"

---

## KEY RULES

1. **Evidence-based**: Support all findings with specific code references
2. **Complete tracing**: Map entire execution flows from entry to exit
3. **Pattern recognition**: Identify and document design patterns used
4. **Contextual**: Consider project-specific requirements and constraints
5. **Actionable**: Provide practical, implementable recommendations
6. **Clear structure**: Follow template sections while adapting to task
7. **Objective**: Present balanced analysis of strengths and weaknesses

- ✅ Has descriptive, meaningful name
- ✅ Contains executive summary with key findings
- ✅ Maps complete architecture and flows
- ✅ Includes specific code references (files and line numbers)
- ✅ Documents patterns and conventions
- ✅ Provides actionable recommendations
- ✅ Follows template structure appropriately
